* todo: figure out how login works for authorization -- I don't have to keep validate the password right -- is there a token or something for them to keep accessing the other endpoints? yup so it is with tokens.

* todo: change my config policy to go back to disabling CORS by default (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50486314/how-to-solve-403-error-in-spring-boot-post-request main answer here) and using @CrossOrigin mapping (https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/ -- and also desoss's answer in the stack overflow link)
