* make compatible with okta and google auth
* long term set up mysql server (Free) --h2 already made persistent
* figure out flyway database rollback? does it even work with H2 -- yes it does. So Flyway is for database migrations but you can also use it to tear down databases for testing and rewrite values for regression tests and such in the databases. The thing is I do not need to generate existing data yet. So might not even be useful for my application
